# U3-Stack Development Plan

## Phase 0: Monorepo Bootstrap

**Goal**: Set up foundational tooling and monorepo structure.

### Tasks:

- [ ] Initialize monorepo using pnpm workspaces.
- [ ] Set up folder structure: `/apps`, `/packages`.
- [ ] Install shared tools: eslint, prettier, tsconfig, dotenv, husky, lint-staged.

### Test Process:

- [ ] Run `pnpm install` across workspaces.
- [ ] Validate correct project references via `pnpm recursive exec`.
- [ ] Add a dummy `hello.ts` in each app/package and import from others to validate TS paths.

### Exit Criteria:

- [ ] All packages interlink correctly.
- [ ] Linting and formatting work across the monorepo.

## Phase 1: UI Library + Multi-Platform Setup

### 1.1: Setup UI Library and Test with Web
