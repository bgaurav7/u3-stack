TITLE: Responsive Styling for UI Components
DESCRIPTION: This CSS defines styles for various UI elements like `.sb-addon`, `.sb-section`, and `.sb-features-grid`, including responsive adjustments using media queries for screen widths up to 800px and 600px. It handles layout, padding, image positioning, and transformations to ensure optimal display across devices.
